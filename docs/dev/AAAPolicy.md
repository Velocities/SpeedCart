# Introduction
The purpose of this document is to explain how each of the AAA responsibilities
must be fulfilled in the development of SpeedCart.
# Authentication
## Overview
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users accessing the SpeedCart application.

## Implementation Details
Authentication should be performed at the entry points of the application where users interact, such as login screens or API endpoints.

## Technologies Used
SpeedCart utilizes modern authentication mechanisms such as Sign In with Google and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication.

## Configuration Instructions
Configuration for authentication mechanisms, including any client IDs, secret keys, and token expiration policies, is managed within the application settings and environment variables.

## Best Practices
- Implement secure authentication protocols such as Federated Identity via Sign In with Google to protect user credentials and prevent unauthorized access.
- Enforce rate limiting to enhance security against brute-force attacks (outsourced to Google).
- Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms to address emerging security vulnerabilities and best practices, including documentation from 3rd party services utilized in all outsourced control.
## Troubleshooting Tips
- Monitor authentication logs and metrics to identify anomalies, suspicious activities, and potential security incidents.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to provide meaningful feedback to users and administrators in case of authentication failures or errors.

# Authorization
## Overview
Authorization determines the level of access and permissions granted to authenticated users within the SpeedCart application.

## Implementation Details
Authorization checks should be performed at the program level directly responsible for performing data operations and enforcing access control policies.

<b>Note:</b> Authorization is yet to be extensively implemented in the SpeedCart app

## Technologies Used
SpeedCart employs role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms to manage user permissions and resource authorization.

## Configuration Instructions
Authorization rules and policies are defined and configured within the application's access control lists (ACLs) or policy management systems.

## Best Practices
- Implement least privilege principles to restrict user access to only the resources and functionalities required to perform their designated tasks.
- Regularly review and update access control policies to reflect changes in user roles, organizational requirements, and compliance regulations.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate authorization vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
## Troubleshooting Tips
- Monitor access logs and audit trails to track user activities, identify unauthorized access attempts, and investigate security breaches or policy violations.
- Implement runtime debugging and logging mechanisms to trace the execution flow and identify potential authorization issues or misconfigurations.

# Accounting
## Implementation Details
Accounting is implemented at various levels within the SpeedCart application to log important events and actions. This includes logging authentication requests and responses, authorization decisions, and any significant system events.

## Technologies Used
Logging in SpeedCart is facilitated by the built-in logging functionality of the programming languages and frameworks used. Additionally, third-party logging libraries may be utilized for more advanced logging features and integrations with logging services.

## Configuration Instructions
Logging configurations, such as log levels, output destinations, and log retention policies, are managed centrally within the application configuration files. These configurations are designed to be easily adjustable to accommodate different logging requirements and environments.

## Best Practices
- Log important events and actions comprehensively but judiciously to avoid overwhelming log files with unnecessary information.
- Ensure that sensitive information such as user credentials or personally identifiable information (PII) is not logged.
- Regularly review and monitor log files to detect and investigate any anomalies or security incidents promptly.
## Troubleshooting Tips
In case of unexpected behavior or errors in the application, consult the relevant log files to gather diagnostic information and trace the root cause of the issue.
Utilize logging levels effectively to prioritize and filter log messages based on their severity, making it easier to focus on relevant information during troubleshooting.
# Conclusion
## Summary of Key Points
This document has outlined the principles and practices for implementing authentication, authorization, and accounting (logging) within the SpeedCart application. By adhering to these guidelines, SpeedCart aims to ensure the security, integrity, and accountability of its operations.

## Importance of Adhering to Security Guidelines
Adhering to robust authentication, authorization, and logging practices is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data, protecting against unauthorized access, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. By prioritizing security at every level of development, SpeedCart strives to build trust and confidence among its users.

## Encouragement for Feedback and Improvement
Continuous evaluation, feedback, and improvement of security practices are essential for staying ahead of emerging threats and evolving security standards. SpeedCart encourages all stakeholders to actively participate in identifying areas for enhancement and providing suggestions for improving the security posture of the application.
